#+title: MPD Notification daemon(?)
#+author: Moskas
#+OPTIONS: \n:t

* About application
It uses notify-rust so it should work with any notification daemon like dunst or KDE/GNOME/XFCE notifications. For album covers it looks inside a directory that mpd returns as song file directory and it checks whether cover.png or cover.jpg exists in the directory and uses it as an icon.
Example screenshot with dunst:
[[./doc/example.png]]
Structure of the notification is:
Summary: Now playing:
Contents: Artist\nTitle\nAlbum
Icon: Album cover
* Dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
[dependencies]
notify-rust = "4"
mpd = "0.0.12"
toml = "0.7.2"
serde = "1.0.152"
#+END_SRC
* Roadmap
- [X] Getting song info
- [ ] Getting album cover
  + Improve regex to match any file with cover in name
  + Improve regex to find covers in subfolders (ex. Album has Disc 1 and Disc 2 directories in which covers are located.)
- [X] Sending notifications on song change
  Kinda works? Rewrite needed for status change handling
- [ ] Sending notifications on status change (play/pause etc.)
- [X] Configuration file support (not everyone uses default mpd settings)
- [ ] Support for running as a systemd daemon
* Configuration
By default application will look for your $HOME/.config directory. It doesn't create it and config file by default. Default fallback config will be added in future commits.
Default config:
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
music_dir = "/home/moskas/Music/"
ip = "127.0.0.1"
port = "6600"
#+END_SRC
The exact same config file is also located in doc directory.
